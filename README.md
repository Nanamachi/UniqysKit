# Uniqys Kit: A blockchain platform for DApps

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/uniqys/UniqysKit.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/uniqys/UniqysKit)

Uniqys Kit is a developer-friendly toolkit to create scalable DApps in [Uniqys Network](https://uniqys.net).
Uniqys Kit has two main components: Chain Core and Easy Framework.

- Chain Core provides fast and scalable blockchain infrastructure by using the sidechain technology.
- Easy Framework enables developers to create DApps without being conscious of the blockchain.

For details, please visit our [website](https://uniqys.net/kit) and [documentation](https://uniqys.github.io/UniqysKitDocs/).

## Current status

This is a beta version of Uniqys Kit, and it is still under development.
It is ready for building a blockchain and is able to take consensus to maintain a sole application state in the network.

We would appreciate if you could give us your feedback via GitHub issue, [Gitter](https://gitter.im/uniqys/UniqysKit-preview), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uniqys).

### Chain Core

`chain-core-dev` package is removed, and `chain-core` package is available.
`chain-core` implements Tendermint consensus algorithm and thereby it can construct a secure blockchain network.
It only supports static validator set, and dynamic validator set will be implemented in the future version.

### Easy Framework

Easy Framework is ready for developers to use, and it now provides you necessary data for building DApps (i.e. timestamp, block hash).

## Getting started

### Setup for [ndenv](https://github.com/riywo/ndenv)

```sh
$ ndenv install v10.9.0
```

### Install

:memo: This project is created as monorepo. You must run bootstrap before building Uniqys Kit.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run bootstrap
```

### Build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Test

```sh
$ npm test
```

### Try Samples

After building Uniqys Kit, please see [packages/samples directory.](packages/samples/)

### Create Your DApp

Please check our [documentation](https://uniqys.github.io/UniqysKitDocs/) for instruction.
To see our examples, please refer to [packages/samples](packages/samples/).

Building a DApp with Uniqys Kit is mostly as simple as building a modern web application.

- To implement a server-side API, use Memcached (with permanent data storage) for the database. You can use the existing memcached library.
- To implement a frontend, use Easy Client for accessing your server-side API. Consider Easy Client as an HTTP client library (like Axios) with features to sign a transaction.
